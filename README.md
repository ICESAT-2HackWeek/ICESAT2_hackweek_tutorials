# ICESat-2 Hackweek Tutorials
Combined repository for final tutorials presented during the ICESat-2 HackWeek at the Univeristy of Washington on June 17-21, 2019

## Background
The [ICESat-2 Cryospheric Science Hackweek](https://icesat-2hackweek.github.io/) was a 5-day hackweek held at the University of Washington. Participants learned about technologies used to access and process ICESat-2 data with a focus on the cryosphere. Mornings consisted of interactive lectures/tutorials, and afternoon sessions involved facilitated exploration of datasets and hands-on software development.  

The tutorials were largely developed by volunteer instructors.  Each tutorial was prepared and distributed as a separate repository under the [ICESat-2 Hackweek Github organization](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek).  At the beginning of each tutorial, participants cloned the repository and interactively worked through the material with the instructor.  

This ICESat2_hackweek_tutorials repository was created to centralize the final content from all tutorial repositories and to provide a snapshot "release" of the material presented during the hackweek with a DOI for distribution to the larger community.
